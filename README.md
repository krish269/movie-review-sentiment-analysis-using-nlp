Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP
A machine learning project that classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative. This repository contains Python scripts to train a sentiment analysis model on the IMDB 50K Movie Review dataset and then use that model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.

The project is structured to separate the time-consuming model training from the fast, real-time prediction, making it efficient for repeated use.

Key Features
Sentiment Classification: Predicts if a movie review is positive or negative.

NLP Pipeline: Implements a standard NLP preprocessing workflow including:

HTML tag removal

Lowercasing and punctuation removal

Tokenization

Stop word removal

Lemmatization

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into meaningful numerical features for the model.

Efficient Two-Part Workflow:

A script to train and save the model (train_model.py).

A separate script to load the saved model and perform instant predictions (predict_review.py).

Interactive Prediction: Allows users to input their own reviews and get immediate sentiment predictions.

How It Works
Training (train_model.py): The script first loads the IMDB dataset. It then cleans and preprocesses each review. Using the cleaned text, it creates a TF-IDF feature matrix and trains a Logistic Regression model. The trained model and the TF-IDF vectorizer are then saved to disk as .pkl files.

Prediction (predict_review.py): This script loads the saved sentiment_model.pkl and tfidf_vectorizer.pkl files. It provides a command-line interface for the user to enter a new movie review. The script preprocesses the input text using the same steps as the training script, vectorizes it, and feeds it to the loaded model to get a sentiment prediction.

Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas: For data manipulation and loading the CSV dataset.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For core NLP tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including:

TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction.

LogisticRegression for the classification model.

train_test_split and metrics for model evaluation.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.

Dataset
This project uses the IMDB 50K Movie Review Dataset. It consists of 50,000 movie reviews evenly split into 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing, with a balanced distribution of positive and negative reviews.

You must have the IMDB Dataset.csv file in the same directory as the Python scripts.

Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git)
cd movie-review-sentiment-analysis

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, and joblib).

4. Run the Training Script
First, you need to train the model. This only needs to be done once. Make sure IMDB Dataset.csv is in the project directory.

python train_model.py

This will preprocess the data, train the model, and create two files: sentiment_model.pkl and tfidf_vectorizer.pkl.

5. Run the Prediction Script
Once the model is trained, you can run the prediction script anytime to analyze new reviews.

python predict_review.py

The script will load the saved model and prompt you to enter a review.

Example:

Enter your review: This movie was an absolute masterpiece! The acting was incredible and the plot was gripping.
Predicted Sentiment: POSITIVE
